#### Chose "Earthquakes from the last 7 days" GeoJSON feed from USGS.  Plotted the earthquakes on a map using Leaflet.js based on their latitude and longitude.  Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and darker in color.  Included popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.Created a legend that will provide context for your map data.  http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php

#### Pulled in a second data set from https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates.  Drew tectonic plate lines on the Leaflet map with different base maps and layer controls.
